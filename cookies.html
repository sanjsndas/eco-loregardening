                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Ecolore ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website at www.ecolore.com (the "Website"). By using the Website, you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with this policy.</p>
                
                <h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
                
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners.</p>
                
                <p>Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie remains valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user). A session cookie expires at the end of the user session when the web browser is closed.</p>
                
                <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
                
                <p>We use cookies for various purposes, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>To enable certain functions of the Website</li>
                    <li>To provide analytics about how visitors use our site</li>
                    <li>To store your preferences and personalize content</li>
                    <li>To improve the security of our site</li>
                    <li>To deliver targeted advertising where permitted by law</li>
                    <li>To remember your preferences for future visits</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Essential Cookies</h4>
                <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Performance Cookies</h4>
                <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Functional Cookies</h4>
                <p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
                
                <h4>4. Targeting Cookies</h4>
                <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>
